## Hi there, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding as a hobby since 2016, trying out several different languages and frameworks, but after 2 years, I decided to double down on full stack JavaScript development. Now I'm navigating my way through web dev tech with a focus on React, Node, Express and variations of SQL and NoSQL databases. I'm a life-long learner and excited to both soak up and give back as much knowledge as I can.
